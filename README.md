# Typescript game

A small text-based game which I develop in Typescript and Webpack. I'm trying out a few programming concepts like DI in typescript.

2. run npm i
3. run npm start

## Deployment

Deploying this project is as simple as running _npm run build_ and putting the /dist folder somewhere save.
